title: "Rivian Announces Autonomy & AI Day - RAP1 Processor Unveiled!"
---

🚗 Excited to share that Rivian officially unveiled the **Rivian Autonomy Processor (RAP1)** at their first Autonomy & AI Day! RAP1 is a custom 5nm AI inference chip delivering 1600 sparse TOPS for autonomous driving compute.

I'm incredibly proud to have contributed to this milestone during my internships with the RAP1 Silicon Team, where I developed system-level testcases and verification infrastructure that helped validate this groundbreaking chip. Seeing the technology I worked on being announced publicly and integrated into Rivian's third-generation Autonomy Computer (ACM3) is truly rewarding!

The RAP1 chip features:
- 1600 sparse INT8 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second)
- 5 billion pixels per second processing power
- RivLink low-latency interconnect technology
- Custom 5nm multi-chip module design

RAP1 will power the ACM3 and is expected to ship on R2 models starting at the end of 2026, bringing Rivian closer to their goal of delivering Level 4 autonomy.
