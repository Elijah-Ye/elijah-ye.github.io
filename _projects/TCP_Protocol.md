We used `UDP` to implement our own version of `TCP`. We are able to tolerate packet drops, allow other concurrent connections a fair chance, and it is not overly nice to other connections (should not give up the entire bandwidth to other connections).

## Running the Program

In order to run the program, you need to have two VM instances. In our case, we used VirtualBox and fired up two Linux VM instances on our local machine. For more information, please check the original [github repository](https://github.com/Elijah-Ye/TCP_Protocol).

### Client

```
$ make
$ ./reliable_receiver
```

### Server
```
$ make
$ ./reliable_sender [hostname] [port] [filename] [bytesToTransfer]
```


### To run program with customized speed and drop rate

If your network interface inside the VM is `eth0`, then
run (from inside the VM) the following command:

```
$ sudo tc qdisc del dev eth0 root 2>/dev/null
```

to delete existing tc rules. Then use,
```
$ sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1:0 netem delay 20ms loss 5%
```
followed by
```
$ sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent 1:1 handle 10: tbf rate 20Mbit burst 10mb latency 1ms
```

will give you a 20Mbit, 20ms RTT link where every packet sent has a 5% chance to get dropped.
Simply omit the `loss n%` part to get a channel without artifcial drops.
(You can run these commands just on the sender; running them on the receiver as well won’t
make much of a difference, although you’ll get a 20ms RTT if you don’t adjust the delay to
account for the fact that it gets applied twice.)
