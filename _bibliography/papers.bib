  title={Exploiting Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) for Large Language Model Inference},
  author={Kim, Hyungyo and Ye, Gaohan and Wang, Nachuang and Yazdanbakhsh, Amir and Kim, Nam Sung},
  abstract={The ever-increasing number of parameters in Large Language Models (LLMs) demands many expensive GPUs for both inference and training. This is because even such a high-end GPU such as NVIDIA A100 can store only a subset of parameters due to its limited memory capacity. To reduce the number of required GPUs, especially for inference, we may exploit the large memory capacity of (host) CPU to store not only all the model parameters but also intermediate outputs which also require a substantial memory capacity. However, this necessitates frequent data transfers between CPU and GPU over the slow PCIe interface, creating a bottleneck that hinders the accomplishment of both low latency and high throughput in inference. To address such a challenge, we first propose CPU-GPU cooperative computing that exploits the Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) capability of the latest Intel CPU, codenamed Sapphire Rapids (SPR). Second, we propose an adaptive model partitioning policy that determines the layers of a given LLM to be run on CPU and GPU, respectively, based on their memory capacity requirement and arithmetic intensity. As CPU executes the layers with large memory capacity but low arithmetic intensity, the amount of data transferred through the PCIe interface is significantly reduced, thereby improving the LLM inference performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that CPU-GPU cooperative computing, based on this policy, delivers 12.1x lower latency and 5.4x higher throughput than GPU-only computing for OPT-30B inference when both CPU-GPU and GPU-only computing store the model in CPU memory.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
