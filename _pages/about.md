Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Elijah Gaohan Ye. `Elijah` is my English first name, and `Gaohan` is my Chinese first name. I am an Master of Science student at [University of Illinois](https://illinois.edu/), studying [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/). 

<h4 id="my_info"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> $cat my_interest </code></h4>

I am interested in Computer Achitecture especially on how we can use hardware and software co-design to help accelerate LLM. 

Other than my academic interest, I love to play basketball and workout.
