Hi! 👋

My name is Elijah Gaohan Ye. `Elijah` is my English first name, and `Gaohan` is my Chinese first name. I am a Master of Science student at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), studying [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) (Expected May 2026). I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the same institution in December 2023 with a GPA of 3.96/4.00.

I am currently working as a Teaching Assistant for Digital Systems Laboratory (ECE 385), where I evaluate SystemVerilog/FPGA projects and conduct technical demonstrations of digital circuits and SoC designs.

<h4 id="my_experience"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> $cat my_experience </code></h4>

I have industry experience at [Rivian Automotive](https://rivian.com) as a Design Verification Intern on the RAP1 Silicon Team, where I developed system-level testcases for RAP1 (Rivian Autonomy Processor), a custom 5nm AI inference chip delivering 1600 sparse TOPS for autonomous driving compute. I enhanced verification coverage, developed system-level tests, and worked with UVM testbenches.

My research focuses on computer architecture, particularly hardware-software co-design for accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs). I have published work on "Exploiting Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) for LLM Inference" in IEEE Computer Architecture Letters (CAL) 2024, which received the **IEEE Best Paper Award**. I'm currently working on transparent memory management for large-scale LLM training and tuning, and co-authored "ReScue: Reliable and secure CXL memory" published at HPCA 2026.

<h4 id="my_skills"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> $cat my_skills </code></h4>

**Programming:** System Verilog (Advanced), C/C++ (Advanced), UVM/OVM, Python, CUDA

**Hardware Design:** RTL Design, CPU Architecture, RISC-V, x86, CXL/PCIe, Cache Design

**Tools:** Verdi, VCS, Git, Linux, Intel Extension for PyTorch, Performance Analysis

Beyond my academic and research interests in computer architecture and LLM acceleration, I enjoy playing basketball and working out to stay active and maintain a healthy work-life balance.
